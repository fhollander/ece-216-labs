I affirm that I have not given or received any unauthorized help on this assignment, and that this work is my own.

This program reads from a 48 count encoder using change notification interrupts, and interprets the data to understand the direction and number of rotations of a motor. A pulse width modulation signal is also output from the board to turn the motor two rotations before stopping, while also displaying the degrees rotated by the motor on the LCD screen.
Note that we used Pin 72 for our signal from OC1, Pin 83 to yellow wire on encoder, and Pin 84 to white wire on encoder. We followed the standard configuration for the rest of the setup as described in the lab manual.
